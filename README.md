# Get_Live-Location-
A simple weather app using Geolocation and WeatherAPI. It fetches real-time temperature and location info based on user coordinates. Practiced working with APIs, async/await, and dynamic data display using JavaScript.


In this project, I practiced how to:

Use the Geolocation API to get the user's current latitude and longitude.

Fetch real-time weather data using the WeatherAPI service.

Display the current temperature and location (city, region, country) on the webpage.

Work with async/await, fetch(), and API response handling in JavaScript.

This helped me understand how to:

Access device location (with user permission)

Make dynamic API calls using coordinates

Parse and display useful data from a JSON response

üìç It shows the current location and temperature when the user clicks the Get Location button.
